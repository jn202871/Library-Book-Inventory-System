# Library Inventory

Simple program using a BST to store and retrieve nodes that represent books in a library.

The information of each book can be modified and the books can be checked in and out.

Book information and current CRN value will be stored in the two included text files.

CRN values start at 0 and automatically increase and save.

Note that deleted books CRN values are not reused, EX. if book a with CRN 2 is deleted and there is book b with CRN 3, a new book c will have a CRN of 4 instead of 2.

NOTE: CRN.TXT & BST.TXT MUST BE IN THE SAME DIRECTORY AS THE .JAR
